**sWAF** is a **simple Web Application Firewall** [docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/swafproject/swaf), pre-configured to be easily used with your web services architecture. It runs [NGINX](https://www.nginx.com/) as a dedicated reverse proxy with [ModSecurity v3](https://www.modsecurity.org/) and [NAXSI](https://github.com/nbs-system/naxsi) modules using the [OWASPÂ® ModSecurity Core Rule Set (CRS)](https://coreruleset.org/) for the security layers, all over an [Alpine Linux](https://www.alpinelinux.org/) image.
